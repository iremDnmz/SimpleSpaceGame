There is a UFO object which is not visible on the initial screen. When the user clicks the left mouse button, the UFO object is displayed at the click location. Subsequently, with every new click, the UFO object is relocated on the screen. There is two modes of animation: manual and autonomous. The user can switch between the modes using the F1 function key. In manual mode, the user can control the movement and direction of the UFO object using arrow keys. In the autonomous mode, the UFO object animates in its current direction, and the user can change its direction using arrow keys. The current mode and direction is displayed on the screen. Additionally, UFO moves in the opposite direction after reaching the end of the frame.
